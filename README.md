make-workflows.sh for GitHub Actions
====================================

GitHub Workflow description in YAML does not support anchors.
There are several workarounds => anyway [they](#links) come to building-editing workflow yaml from source.
So I suggest yet another one `make-workflows.sh` based on YAML tool [`yq`](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) version 4.

<sub>\<spoiler\>All these code and repo is written around `yq eval 'explode(.)'`\</spoiler\></sub>

### USAGE
0. [Install](#ways-to-install) `make-workflows.sh` to reachable place inside or outside of your repo, i.e. '.github/'
1. Put your workflows to `.github/*.src.yml`
2. (recommended) `pre-commit install` and edit [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](/.pre-commit-config.yaml) according to where `make-workflows.sh` is placed.
   <sub>(altenative optional) Copy or link `pre-commit-hook.sh` to `.git/hooks/pre-commit`  
   Like `ln -s ../../.github/pre-commit-hook.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit`</sub>

```
$ ./make-workflows.sh --help
make-workflows:
   This script expands '*.src.yml' from $1..$[N-1] (default: REPO_ROOT/.github/)
   to $N (default:REPO_ROOT/.github/workflows/) with corresponding name '*.yml'
   Main goal is to dereference YAML anchors.
   Deals only with Git cached/indexed files until --worktree passed.
   DEBUG: use option -x
   NOTE: spaces in filenames are not allowed to keep code simplicity.
Usage:
    make-workflows.sh [--worktree] [dirs_from... [dir_to]]
    make-workflows.sh [--help]
Options:
   --worktree       List files and get contents from working tree
                    instead of git index
   -h, --help       show this help
   -x, --trace, +x, --no-trace   enable/disable bash trace
   -i, --install
   --update
   -V, --version
```

### Automate using pre-commit (recommended)
There is a nice tool [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to do checks and some actions just before commit. The tool is called by Git pre-commit hook.

Making workflows is better being automated â€“ just 
```sh
$ pre-commit install
```
and add next sample to [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](/.pre-commit-config.yaml)
```yaml
repos:
- repo: local
  hooks:
  - id: make-workflows
    name: Make GitHub workflows from *.src.yml
    entry: bash -c '.github/make-workflows.sh && git add .github/workflows'
    language: system
    files: '.github/.*\.src\.ya?ml'
    pass_filenames: false
```
> NOTE: pay attention to path to `make-workflows.sh`

> NOTE2: pay attention to path(s) where source files are stored `files: 'PATH_REGEXP'`


## Ways to install

```

2. using own facility, installs to /usr/local/bin
```
curl 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kuvaldini/make-workflows.sh/main/make-workflows.sh' -LsSf | bash -s -- --install
```
> NOTE: may require `...| sudo bash...`

3. node package manager
```
npm install kuvaldini/make-workflows.sh
```
or `npm install git+https://github.com/kuvaldini/make-workflows.sh`
